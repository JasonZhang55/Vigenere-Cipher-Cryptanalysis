Problem 1: go install vigenere-encrypt
./vigenere-encrypt key plaintxt.txt > ciphertxt.txt

Decrypt is the same.

Problem 2: go install vigenere-keylength
./vigenere-keylength ciphertxt.txt
The key length will be printed on the terminal.

Problem 3: go install vigenere-cryptanalyze
./vigenere-vigenere-cryptanalyze ciphertxt.txt
The key length and the most probable key will be printed on the terminal.
Then, you can use the key to decrypt the ciphertxt.txt using vigenere-decrypt.

Problem 4 is in the doc named "Problem4".
